    <!--HISTORY-->
    <p>
      The Bi-State Chapter was organized in 1985 from a need to provide a
      technical forum and a pleasant social environment to exchange ideas for
      ASHRAE members in the counties surrounding White Plains, N.Y. The New York
      City, Northern New Jersey and Connecticut Chapters were all considered too
      far to travel to meetings in New York City, Central New Jersey and
      Hartford.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial chartering meeting was held in the offices of Wolff &amp;
      Munier, Inc. on February 2, 1985, during which Charles J. Procell was
      elected President of the steering committee for the chartering purposes.
      He had successfully chartered a chapter in Rockford, Illinois, in 1972.
    </p>

    <p>
      A membership meeting was held on March 5,1985 in the White Plains Hotel,
      where 40 ASHRAE members signed the charter petition. At this meeting, the
      name Bi-State was suggested as an invitation to our Connecticut members.
      The late Thomas S. Brown was present at the meeting. He was the Director
      and Regional Chairman of Region I. Tom was instrumental in the chartering
      process after conversations during 1984 with Charlie Procell. In a March
      11, 1985 letter to Charlie, Tom stated, "Without doubt, this Chapter will
      become one of the outstanding Chapters in Region I. I wish you and all the
      people who have worked to make this a reality, my congratulations and
      thanks."
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the March meeting, a letter was sent to the New York City
      Chapter requesting that they relinquish the counties of Putnam &amp;
      Westchester in New York and Fairfield County in Connecticut to the
      Bi-State Chapter. Similar letters were sent to the Connecticut and
      Northern New Jersey Chapters for the relinquishment of Orange and Rockland
      Counties, and Dutchess County, respectively. All three Chapter Presidents
      responded quickly in the affirmative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The April meeting included a field trip to the General Foods Headquarters,
      and the speaker at the May meeting was Mayor of the City of White Plains
      and Engineer, Alfred Del Vecchio, P.E. Thus, a tradition of high quality
      program for the monthly meetings was initiated. The formal "Petition to
      Society" was submitted following the April meeting. The charter was
      received in record time and was issued on June 4, 1985 at a meeting at the
      White Plains Hotel were ASHRAE President Bob MacDonald presented the
      charter to Chapter President Charlie Procell. The list of Presidents and
      President-Elects are enumerated below:

      Initially, the chapter was holding technical seminars on energy
      conservation and heating/cooling load calculations, etc. After one year of
      operation Perry Cuomo received the CRS award in membership in 1986 and the
      following year Hank Munier received the award for the most improved
      chapter in 1987. Awards were also given to Bob Gironda for the technical
      affairs and the Region Award of Merit was given to Charles Procell. For
      1988-1989 terms the chapter received the first PAOE award. Two of our
      charter members, Paul Bourquin (June 10,1990) and Charles J. Procell
      (January25, 1992) have been elected Fellows of ASHRAE. Art Breuer, P.E.
      and Robert Roston, P.E. received awards for membership and research
      promotion, respectively, on June 10, 1990.

      Initial meetings were held at the White Plains Hotel and then changed to
      New York Polytechnic Institute, and then Tino's on Saw Mill River Road,
      the Marriott Hotel on Route 119, the Cabin Restaurant in Valhalla and now
      is held at the Casa Rina Restaurant in Thornwood, N.Y. The food is better
      at the same cost and the separate room provides a better environment for
      the tech sessions and the main program.

      We would be remiss in not mentioning William Timm and James Zonino that
      lifted the chapter to new heights at the time of their service as
      President. James Zonino's dedication to Bi-State ASHRAE will be remembered
      by all of us for a long time. He attended a meeting at the Tarrytown
      Hilton to confirm arrangements for the year's CRC 2001 one week before he
      passed away with cancer. During this time of renewal, Joseph Ting, former
      Director and Regional Chair - Region I, joined the chapter and spearheaded
      the CRC 2001 as General Chair with the "TOPS", Technical, Operations,
      Planning and Social subcommittees. The CRC was a great success that
      featured the "first paperless CRC" in Region I and a trade show, technical
      seminars, and technical tours of the Sheet Metal Workers Training Facility
      in Brewster, NY, sponsored by SMACNA. As a result of this activity the
      chapter raised $20,000 for a scholarship fund.

      We have all made a conscious decision to make a career in the HVAC
      Industry over the next 20-30 years. Why not take an active role in being
      part of the pleasant, friendly and educational environment at a monthly
      Bi-State ASHRAE meeting in centrally located Thornwood. Who knows you
      might find a pearl of wisdom or meet a new friend.
